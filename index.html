    <h3>A "Rich" History</h3>
    <p>
        Over the past 100 years, the NHL has strived to bring the very best in hockey entertainment
        to people around the world. From the Original Six teams that started it all, to the 32
        franchises that run the league today, it has been an absolute wild ride for the NHL.
        Over the years, the NHL has seen lockouts,  pandemics, 19 different team relocations and
        foldings, and 30 expansion teams. The NHL is trying to spread the outreach of hockey
        everywhere, including Europe, where the NHL has hosted international games similar to
        the NFL in order to gain viewers. With all these new markets, the NHL feels they have
        successfully brought hockey to the people—or at least they thought they had.

    <h4>Hockey is for Everyone? Yeah Right!</h4>
    <p>
        Over the past two years, NHL ticket prices have skyrocketed, almost doubling for most teams.
        For a league that has been around for 100 years, there hasn’t been an increase like this one.
        Sports analyst Michael d’Amore, a Falk College alumnus, says that dynamic pricing is the main
        reason for the change. This pricing is impacted by a range of factors, from team success to
        the worth of the franchises and even the taxes that these teams pay. All of these factors
        have made prices comparable to a family vacation for some.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It definitely isn’t inflation or household income,” said d’Amore. “NHL ticket prices
        increased because teams discovered demand was inelastic, corporate and tourist buyers set
        the clearing price, and expansion franchises normalized premium pricing across the league.”
    </p>

    <h3>Inelastic Demand</h3>
    <p>
        Over the past decade, NHL teams have been increasing their ticket prices in hopes of making
        the most money possible. D’Amore said that since teams don’t have a cap when it comes to
        selling tickets, they will sell tickets at monumentally high prices to draw people in.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s really annoying for us NHL fans,” said d’Amore. “Teams increase their prices about $3.37 per win!.”
    </p>
    <p>
        For those who don’t know, dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy that uses analytics such as
        team success and prior data to set prices based on supply and demand. There is obviously
        very high demand for NHL tickets, which is why we are seeing such high prices.

    <h4>Corporations and Tourism</h4>
    <p>
        When it comes to corporations, many corporations try to invest their money in well-known
        and successful franchises. A key example of this is the Original Six teams. These teams
        have many sponsors, such as Molson, Canadian Tire, Scotiabank, Dunkin’, and even FanDuel.
        When teams have sponsors like this, they raise prices and use their corporate power to
        bring people in, which results in increases like this.

    <p>
        The Original Six teams have been increasing their prices monumentally, and it has an
        effect not just on corporations, but on tourists as well. As stated earlier, the NHL has
        been expanding hockey to new markets like Europe, and this has brought in many tourists
        as the NHL continues to highlight its Original Six teams. These teams then make money off
        tourists who would pay almost anything to see one of these teams play.
    </p>

<section class="content bounce slide-in">
    <h5>Expansion Pricing</h5>
    <p>
        The NHL has also been expanding its league in efforts to bring in more money and gain new
        markets of fans. In the past 15 years, the NHL has gained three new teams and one team that
        was relocated. The NHL has received the Winnipeg Jets, Vegas Golden Knights, and the Seattle
        Kraken. They have also received the Utah Mammoth, which was a team relocated from the poorly
        run Arizona Coyotes franchise. Vegas, Seattle, and Utah, being the more recent teams, have
        seen a surge in high pricing, as you can see above, and they continue to grow as their
        franchises grow. There is no ceiling for these new teams, and they feel that since they are
        new, they are allowed to take advantage of their fans with premium pricing, labeling fans
        as being “part of history.” All of these teams have seen increases from 2024.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        To conclude, the NHL will continue to use dynamic pricing to impact fans, concessions, and
        organizations for years to come. This year was a wake-up call for the NHL, as ticket prices
        were almost doubled for most franchises. If the NHL wants to continue to thrive, they are
        going to reach a point where fans will no longer pay these absurdly high prices, and there
        will be major consequences from a sudden drop, similar to the rapid increase. The NHL may
        hit somewhat of a recession in the foreseeable future regarding the way it spends its money.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I can tell you one thing, and that is these sudden increases made by the NHL on tickets are
        going to have a major impact within the next decade,” said d’Amore. “I really do hope that
        the NHL switches back to its original pricing and really hones in on its mission statement
        that hockey is for everyone.”
